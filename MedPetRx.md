# MedPetRx – Project Overview & Vision

## Executive Summary

In human medicine, outcomes are analyzed across tens of thousands of patients. In veterinary emergency care, life-or-death decisions are often made with fragmented or nonexistent medical records. This gap affects patient safety, clinical outcomes, and operational efficiency.

MedPetRx is a centralized veterinary medical-record hub designed to unify pet health data across emergency rooms, general practices, urgent care, and specialty clinics. By enabling instant access to a pet’s complete medical history, MedPetRx aims to improve emergency care outcomes while unlocking long-term strategic value for veterinary organizations and pharmaceutical partners.

Working on the ER floor provides firsthand exposure to the consequences of incomplete medical records. Missing medication histories, chronic conditions, prior diagnostics, allergies, and vaccination records can immediately change the trajectory of care.

During pharmacy school, veterinary pharmacology and data-analysis projects consistently revealed a systemic limitation: veterinary medicine lacks unified, large-scale clinical data. Most studies are based on fewer than 100 patients, limiting real-world understanding of medication safety, outcomes, and trends—especially in emergency settings.

MedPetRx was created to address this critical gap.
